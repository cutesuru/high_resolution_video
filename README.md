# Creating High resolution videos and images
Used a cnn model to create high resolution videos and images .

## Documentation ##
Pre-configured weights are used in this network.Here is the pth file [pre_weight](superres_epoch100-44c6958e.pth)

Framework: Pytorch
Input image size: (224 x 224)
Output image size: (672 x 672)
Libraries Used:
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV

## References ##
1)Model used is taken from [Superresolution using an efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/super_resolution)

## Example ##
```out=torch_model(img_y)```
[images](high_resolute_image.jpg)

## Contributions ##

Here videos created from the model doesn't have audio.So I would recommend anyone to add audio to the video which would increase the efficiency of algorithm.Apart from that try to generate images which are better resolute than images generated by this model.
